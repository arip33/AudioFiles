This paper aims to build a framework that utilizes the Data Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) in order to experimentally test its congestion control system.  DCCP is a hybrid between TCP and UDP in that it offers congestion control across an unreliable transmission protocol along with a connection-oriented setup and teardown design. Applications that do not require a reliable connection, but desire to trasmit data at high rates are the ideal users of DCCP, i.e. audio streaming, video streaming, and video games. This paper proposes the design of an audio chatting application that has a framework capable of swapping out different transport layer protocols.  Specifically, three protocols were selected: DCCP, TCP, and UDP.  By abstracting out the transport layer at the application level, we can easily compare and contrast the differences in jitter and packet loss between the three different transport layer protocols in an audio streaming/chatting environment.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Data Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport layer protocol that
implements congestion control over an unreliable network~\cite{kohler06}. 
This protocol is a hybrid between UDP and TCP in that it contains the benefits
of unreliability provided by UDP along with the congestion control system found in 
TCP. DCCP originated due to the problem that occurs when transmitting data
at high rates across a network with overloading background traffic. In this
scenario, UDP will continue to transmit packets over the network, which will 
likely be dropped and increase network congestion while TCP would increasingly
slow down and continue to try and resend packets that may not be relevant by 
the time they arrive at their destination such as in meadia streaming 
applications.

DCCP is currently at the proposed standard RFC status (4340-4342).  It is 
currently available for use through the linux socket library~\cite{dccp_website}.  
Its main goal was "to give streaming UDP applications little reason
not to switch to DCCP"~\cite{dccp_wg} by requiring as little overhead as 
possible with full functionality.  The design of DCCP was geared mostly 
toward media streaming applications which include audio, video, and gaming
software where responsiveness is traded for a steadier, less bursty network
connection.

The main goal of this paper is to evaluate DCCP's congestion control performance
by implementing a voice chatting application with DCCP as the underlying audio
transmission protocol.  The voice chatting framework was designed to allow the
user, upon running the application, choose between DCCP, UDP, and TCP as the
transport layer protocol of choice for transmitting audio packets. This is done
by building a framework that abstracts out the transport layer protocol at the
application layer. With this framework, we can observe differences in speed, 
jitter, and packet loss.


\section{Background}
\label{sec:backg}

The most popular transport layer protocols in use are TCP and UDP.  Both of these
protocols have their places in the networks realm and perform well under their 
respective applications.  TCP is known mainly for it reliability along with its
congestion control system while UDP favors timeliness over reliability.  With the
increase in media streaming over the past decade, the idea of timeliness has
become a very important feature.  We as humans, would rather compromise video
quality for synchronized audio and video mainly due to our abilities to deduce
information from segments of information.  Therefore, using a protocol such as UDP
that doesn't worry about loosing a few packets over time is preferred for this type 
of application.  However, when transmitting data that would be corrupt if pieces 
were lost, a reliable protocol must be used to maintain file integrity.  TCP was
designed for this very reason and is widely used as the standard reliable transport
layer protocol.

Even though both of these protocols cover the two extremes: reliable and unreliable
networks, at times a hybrid of the two is desireable.  A situation
that may arise is when media streaming occurs on a congested network. 
Congested networks cause extreme amounts of delay to TCP connections because of
the increased packet loss and the recovery TCP takes to maintain its reliability. 
So using TCP automatically is removed from the desireable options.  For
UDP connections, we can see that there is no traffic speed limit to restrict the
transmission rate UDP utilizes aside from the physical restrictions.  Therefore, 
applications that use UDP actually
may cause a network to become congested due to the high bursts that occur when
trasmitting large blocks of data.  Streaming video with encoding is a good example 
of applications that cause a varying datagram size, specifically MPEG's key frames
verus incremental frames.

DCCP was designed for this very purpose: to support congestion control on an 
unreliable network.  Not only do the authors of DCCP succesfully implement an 
unreliable transport layer protocol with congestion control support, but it also 
sheds light on the complexity of TCP.

\label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}

The voice chatting application was designed to work with many different clients
that communicate with a central server to retrieve information about how to call
other clients as well as the current status of the user's friends. The server 
maintains a database used to authenticate each user upon starting the application.
After logging into the system, the server is used as an intermediary for the clients
to retrieve current information about the user's friends' status, hostname, and
port number. This information can be used to request a chatting session with another
client that is logged onto the server.  Fig.~\ref{fig:setup} shows a high-level
network topology representation of what a set of clients logged into this chatting 
application would look like.  The server and client subsystems are described in
the following sections.
