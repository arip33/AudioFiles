\boldmath 
This paper aims to build a framework that utilizes the Data Congestion Control
Protocol (DCCP) in order to experimentally test its congestion control system. 
DCCP is a hybrid between TCP and UDP in that it offers congestion control across
an unreliable transmission protocol along with a connection-oriented setup and
teardown design. Applications that do not require a reliable connection but
desire to trasmit data at high rates are the ideal users of DCCP.
Possible applications of DCCP include audio streaming, video streaming, and
video games. In this paper we propose the design of an audio chatting
application that has a framework capable of swapping out different transport layer protocols in order to test the
performance of DCCP. The three protocols used for our application are DCCP,
TCP, and UDP. By abstracting out the transport layer at the application level,
we can easily compare and contrast the differences in jitter and packet loss
between the three different transport layer protocols in an audio
streaming environment.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Data Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport layer protocol that
implements congestion control without the reliability of TCP~\cite{kohler06}. It
contains the benefits of unreliability provided by UDP along with the congestion
control system found in TCP. In essence, DCCP is a hybrid between UDP and TCP.
The need for a protocol such as DCCP arose due to the need for congestion
control for applications for which TCP is not an appropriate solution. Because
UDP ignores packet performance when sending over the network, it will simply
send packets as fast as possible, generally resulting in a higher amount of lost
data. By contrast, TCP will keep data integrity, but because packets may be
retransmitted multiple times it is not very applicable for time-sensitive
applications that rely on not being blocked when a packet gets dropped.

DCCP is currently at the proposed standard RFC status (4340-4342). It is
available for use through the Linux socket library~\cite{dccp_website}. Its main
goal was "to give streaming UDP applications little reason not to switch to
DCCP"~\cite{dccp_wg} by requiring as little overhead as possible with full
functionality. The design of DCCP was geared mostly toward media streaming
applications which include audio, video, and gaming software where
responsiveness is traded for a steadier, less bursty network connection.

The main goal of this paper is to evaluate DCCP's congestion control performance
by implementing a voice chatting application with DCCP as the underlying audio
transmission protocol.  The voice chatting framework was designed to allow the
user to choose between DCCP, UDP, and TCP as the transport layer protocol for
transmitting audio packets between clients. This is done by building a framework
that abstracts out the transport layer protocol at the application layer. With
this framework, we can also observe differences in speed, jitter, and packet
loss.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:backg}

The most popular transport layer protocols in use today are TCP and UDP. Though
other protocols do exist, these are the most commonly used ones, particularly
throughout industry as a whole. TCP is known mainly for it reliability and its
congestion control system while UDP is known mainly for its best effort approach
that favors timeliness over reliability. The increase in media streaming over
the past decade has greatly illustrated the need for efficiently sending data
without ensuring reliability. UDP gives us the basic tool to do this. By
streaming over an unreliable protocol and avoiding retransmissions, it is faster and
easier for people to process. We can handle skips from time to time, but it's
harder for us to handle consuming such media out of order. However, when
transmitting data that requires file integrity, such as an archived tarball, a
reliable protocol should be used. TCP was designed for this very reason and is
widely used as the standard reliable transport layer protocol.

Though TCP and UDP address many of the connections needs for various
applications, there has been a growing need for an additional protocol. Consider
what happens when data is sent over a congested network. Because TCP has an
aggressive back-off when it detects congestion and because it will attempt to
retransmit packets (even over a congested network), it is not a suitable
candidate for media streaming applications. By contrast, UDP
will send packets as fast as possible regardless of whether the network is
congested or not, which could result in much more irregularity (and higher
drops) in the arrival of packets for the receiver. Although these protocols have
their ways of dealing with network congestion, they are not always the
appropriate solution depending on typical network conditions and needs of the application.

DCCP was designed for this very purpose: to support congestion control where a
less reliable connection is sufficient. The authors of DCCP created the protocol
with the primary goal of supporting congestion control without reliability, and
in doing so discovered some of the complexities of TCP and how it is able to
work so well.

\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architec}

\label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}

We designed our voice chatting application to work with many different clients
at once. Each client communicates with a central server to retrieve information
about other clients and to keep track of who it can actually call. The
server maintains a database used to authenticate each user upon starting the
application. After logging into the system, the server is used as an
intermediary for the clients to retrieve current information about the user's
friends' statuses, hostname, and port number. This information can be used to
request a chatting session with another client that is logged onto the server. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:setup} shows a high-level network topology representation of what
a set of clients logged into this chatting application would look like. The
server and client subsystems are described in the following sections.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

We found that UDP was the least affected by network congestion in terms of its
sending rate, while DCCP was not significantly affected between 9 Mbits/s and
10 Mbits/s with regards to packet loss and jitter.  Between DCCP and TCP, DCCP
had a higher average packet loss percentage than the other two protocols. DCCP
also had a lower amount of jitter over the congested network, whereas TCP had a
higher amount of jitter. Our results suggest that the congestion contol system
implemented in DCCP behaves similarly to TCP's congestion control, except with a
slightly higher packet loss percentage. This was expected, since the authors of
DCCP modeled their congestion control algorithm closely after TCP's congestion
control. An unexpected result was that DCCP didn't have as large of
a difference in packet loss as TCP. This may be attributed to our small network
setup (2 computers) as well as testing only on a local network.  When running
over the internet, higher delays could occur with an increased likelihood of
lost packets due to many environment variables introduced.  This should be a
focus for future work.
